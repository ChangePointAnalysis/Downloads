## 1. A Survey of Methods for Time Series Change Point Detection
## Samaneh Aminikhanghahid & Diane J. Cook

## Abstract
Change points are abrupt variations in time series data. Such abrupt changes may represent
transitions that occur between states. Detection of change points is useful in modelling and
prediction of time series and is found in application areas such as medical condition monitoring,
climate change detection, speech and image analysis, and human activity analysis. This survey
article enumerates, categorizes, and compares many of the methods that have been proposed to
detect change points in time series. The methods examined include both supervised and
unsupervised algorithms that have been introduced and evaluated. We introduce several criteria to
compare the algorithms. Finally, we present some grand challenges for the community to consider.
